    <h2>This was our kitchen.</h2>
    <h3>A large space that my parents could navigate very well. Me and my sister described our parents as 'Mommy does<br>
        breakfast and Daddy does dinner'. They both can cook very well but that felt the norm. Dad was a chef and knows<br>
        how to operate and run a kitchen. Mom knew how to make a really homely full irish breakfast. We held many<br>
        parties in the house and this was the common area for those.</h3>
