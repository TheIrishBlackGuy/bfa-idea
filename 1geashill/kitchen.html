    <h2>This was our kitchen.</h2>
    <h3>A large space that my parents could navigate very well. Me and my sister described our parents as 'Mommy does
        breakfast and Daddy does dinner'. They both can cook very well but that felt the norm. Dad was a chef and knows
        how to operate and run a kitchen. Mom knew how to make a really homely full irish breakfast. We held many
        parties in the house and this was the common area for those.</h3>
