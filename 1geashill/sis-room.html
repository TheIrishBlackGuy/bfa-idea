    <h2>This was my sister's room.</h2>
    <h3>Smaller than mine but she made use of every space. She had her large bed taking up teh entire back portion of
        the room. But between the bed and entrance was an open space the play games. Very often, I would bring my pirate
        ship, stacked with all my Ben 10 minifuigures, to her room and with those, her Polly Pockets, and her Lil Pet,
        we would get lost for hours making imaginary worlds and story that were different every time we played together.
        Don't think we ever had a repeat story.
        Shop,</h3>
