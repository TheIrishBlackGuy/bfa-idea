    <h2>This was my sister's room.</h2>
    <h3>Smaller than mine but she made use of every space. She had her large bed taking up the entire back portion of
        the room. But between the bed and entrance was an open space the play games. I would often bring my pirate
        ship, stacked with all my Ben 10 minifigures, to her room and with those, her Polly Pockets, and her Lil Pet
        Shop animals, we would get lost for hours making imaginary worlds and stories that were different every time we
        played together. I Don't think we ever had a repeat story.</h3>
