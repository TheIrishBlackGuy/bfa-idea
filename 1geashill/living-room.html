    <h2>This was our living room.</h2>
    <h3>The heart of the home, where we were most comfortable as a family. Though we had the big kitchen, it was always
        nice to have dinner in here, with the fire going in the fireplace, laid back on the sofas while watching The
        Simpsons or a movie. </h3>
    <h3>During the time when we weren't eating dinner, this was where the Playstation 2 was plugged into and so i'd
        occasionally get to play that, one of my first introductions to videogames. And with the fireplace in the same,
        there came a time when my dad taught me how to start a fire so it would be comfortable in the evening when we
        were just chillin' in there. The dancing embers inside the grooves of the logs or the bright glow of the
        heat/fire under the pile of logs was always so pretty to me.</h3>
