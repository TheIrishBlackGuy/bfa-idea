    <h2>This was our living room.</h2>
    <h3>The heart of the home, where we were most comfortable as a family. Though we had the big kitchen, it was always<br>
        nice to have dinner in here, with the fire going in the fireplace, laid back on the sofas while watching The<br>
        Simpsons or a movie. </h3>
    <h3>During the time when we weren't eating dinner, this was where the Playstation 2 was plugged into and so i'd<br>
        occasionally get to play that, one of my first introductions to videogames. And with the fireplace in the same,<br>
        there came a time when my dad taught me how to start a fire so it would be comfortable in the evening when we<br>
        were just chillin' in there. The dancing embers inside the grooves of the logs or the bright glow of the<br>
        heat/fire under the pile of logs was always so pretty to me.</h3>
