                <summary>Young Adult</summary>
                <summary>At a young age, I was a good enough reader that I read above my average 'weight class' you
                    could say. I loved the Artemis Fowl series by Eoin Colfer, the Gone
                    series by Michael Grant, and H.I.V.E. book series by Mark Walden. I was so proud when I finished
                    these series. They would become a foundation of my interests in science fiction.</summary>

            <details>
                <summary>Miscellaneous</summary>
                <summary>A wide array of books in this category. Trivia, joke, and puzzle books. Coloring and 'How
                    to draw' books. This group of books is the start to why I now just like learning stupid or fun new
                    facts.</summary>

        <details>
            <summary>Built by a friend in the neighbourhood, this thing held a large assortment of things.</summary>
            <details>
                <summary>Bottom shelf : Toys</summary>
                <summary>There was a crate for action figures, a box of LEGO and various LEGO sets, and a big truck that
                    held many Hot Wheels.</summary>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Middle Shelf : Jigsaw Puzzles and games</summary>
                <summary>I owned the most puzzles and boardgames in the house. Monopoly was a family favourite but I
                    love my couple hundred piece jigsaw puzzle that I'd just zone out buuilding.</summary>
            </details>

                <summary>Top Shelf : Clothes</summary>
                <summary>Not much to say here... Clothes are clothes. I never really had a particular style. Not on the
                    same shelf but I did large a tub of shoes and runners.</summary>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Open area : Wild card</summary>
                <summary>This was the wild west of my wardrobe. Anything could be in here. Though I had jackets and
                    nicer clothes hanging on their rod, the shelf below was just open space. I was pretty bad at trying
                    to keep my room clean and any time my Granny came over, anything that was not in its correct place
                    she would just throw into that space and quickly close the door for me to find later.</summary>
